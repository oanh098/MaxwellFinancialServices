                            Personal superannuation (often simply known as ‘super’) is money that’s put aside and saved while you’re working, so you can enjoy a regular income later in life when you retire.  These days, the average Australian may expect around 20 years of retirement. By investing money in a superannuation fund, you’re building a nest egg to live on when you’re no longer earning a wage. And the more you put away now, the more you’ll be able to spend in your retirement

                           Super is one of the most valuable assets you’ll have in your life. And it can be the key to enjoying a comfortable retirement. So it makes sense to make the most of it – to get it working hard so you’ll have as much money as possible to retire on. But how do you go about doing that?
