                            Our preeminent exchange rankings on all equity, commodity and futures exchanges coupled with our extensive network of banking and financial
                            relationships enable us to provide unmatched access to pools of liquidity.
                    </p>

                    <p>Our clients have confidence in our ability to execute and clear transactions in their best interest and therefore in the best interest of their clients.
                    </p>
                    <p> As a self-clearing firm, we offer a seamless path from order through execution, settlement, and reporting. Once a trade has been completed, our
                        sophisticated clearing and settlement technology equips middle office to serve as an extension of our brokerages' back-office operations,
                            thereby freeing up their client relation resources.
