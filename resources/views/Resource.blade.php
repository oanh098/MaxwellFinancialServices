                            As a self-clearing firm, we offer a seamless path from order through execution, settlement, and reporting. Once a trade has been completed, our
                        sophisticated clearing and settlement technology equips middle office to serve as an extension of our brokerages' back-office operations,
                            thereby freeing up their client relation resources.
